## How to run this app:
- You will need a TMDB API key https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction
- Clone or donwload the code, install all packages 
- Include your own TMDB API key in a ``.dot`` file
- Run start with ``npm start`` 

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, Node.js, Express, SCSS, Bootstrap, React, TMDB

The purpose of this project:
- Have fun with TMDB API
- Understand React context API better, such as useReducer.

## Optimizations
There are a few things I'd love to upgrade/implement for this porject in the feature.
- Switch from Bootstrap to Material-UI. I think Bootstrap has very limited styles to choose from. As a result websites styled with Bootstrap tend to look similar.
- Upgrade the pagination in TMDB API to display total page up to 100.
- I'd also love to setup the backend for this project so I can have a Bookmark and a Watched feature. 

## Lessons Learned:

While using the React context API, I learned a few things about useReducer hook. 
- It's a pure function that is  used to maniupualte part of the app state.
